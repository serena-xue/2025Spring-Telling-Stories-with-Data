# The final data story
> Include a link to your final data story on Shorthand, Esri StoryMaps, etc. here. 

[https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/people-like-you-more-than-you-think-another-way-to-alleviate-social-anxiety/index.html](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/people-like-you-more-than-you-think-another-way-to-alleviate-social-anxiety/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

1. Deliberate statements. Revise the whole piece to a more relaxed and approachable tone and sentences that weren't very logical.
2. Adjust tableau public insertion code to make the visualization better displayed.
3. Normalize references.
4. Add practical advice below each section (Before/After/During) of Chapter "Break Anxiety Spiral".
5. Add disclaimer.
6. Action of solve a problem from a comment "The 'Before Conversation', 'After Conversation', headers are confusing": Add strikethrough conclusions from chapter "Anxiety Spiral" in chapter "Break Anxiety Spiral".
7. Revise url for ADAA: redirect to "Treatment help" page instead of ADAA homepage.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

Audience: Young people who are bothered by social anxiety that do not progress to a medical condition. 

Make the article more approachable by touching up the language again and adding more practice notes.

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process. Include any other information that helps round out your data story. 

1. Add an arrow to the bar chart to visualize the data trend more visually.
2. Use tableau to make a vertical dumbbell chart, make one endpoint smaller by calculating fields, and deal with the problem of overlapping endpoints of the same dumbbell causing one endpoint to cover the other.
3. Zoom in from “two people laughing and talking” to “one of them seems to be frowning” to reflect anxiety in socialization.
4. In addition to logical statements, mental truths are cited to make the statements easier to understand.
5. The use of "we" is more intimate than "you" and "they", especially in comforting and appealing articles.
6. A yellowish background and low saturation color-usage are more intimate and make audience feel comfortable.
7. Pratical steps are neccessary. These add values to the story.
8. Disclaimer is neccessary.

Some reflections: 
1. Tried to display the spiral in a circle, moving the viewpoint to each node in turn to better show its circulation. But find it too hard to implement with Shorthand.
2. Wanted to add accompanying images to each section in "Anxiety Spiral" and "Break Anxiety Spiral", but didn't find the ideal way to embed.
3. The display performance of two bullet graphs is not ideal enough. Consider to seek more advice to revise them.

Use this section to capture any additional special notes or information necessary. If there is additional information for your shorthand readers that you've placed on this page, link from Shorthand to this page. Make sure to double-check that you aren't using copyright material and that you have added / updated any citations or other content that you used to create your data story.

## AI acknowledgements
> If you used AI to help you complete this assignment (within the parameters of the instruction and course guidelines), detail your use of AI for this assignment here.
(During the overall work in this project)I use AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek) for this work and there is no copy from AI. AI usage includes:
1. Brainstorm ideas.
2. Ask for instructions on how to use Tableau and write formulas for calculated fields.
3. Generate an image on page2 "Have you ever..." (prompt: a minimalist drawing of two stick figures talking, laughing).
4. Ask for word-usage advice (Tell me the differences, explaining with examples, between: due to/owing to/thanks to/because of).
