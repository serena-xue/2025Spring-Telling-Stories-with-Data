|Which part impress you most?|The arrows on the graph. They make graphs clear to understand.|Examples of anxious thoughts. That's exactly what bothers me.|The animation effects on the opening.|
|Could you politely provide some advice to make this better?|Bar plots are too many, I think. Various types are more helpful.|Maybe you can add contacts of instructions below.|Change the pronouns to "we", that's more close than "you".|

## AI acknowledgements
I use AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek) for this work:
1. Generate anxious thoughts (“Did I complain too much?”, etc.).
2. Instructions on how to use Tableau and write formulas for calculated fields.
3. Generate image on page2 (two stick figures are talking, smiling).
4. Beautify the expression. I give AI draft in simple English and ask AI to turn into friendly and flow style.
5. List resources for anxiety help.
