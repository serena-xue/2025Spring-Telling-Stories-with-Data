|Which part impress you most?|The arrows on the graph. They make graphs clear to understand.|Examples of anxious thoughts. That's exactly what bothers me.|The animation effects on the opening.|
|Could you politely provide some advice to make this better?|Bar plots are too many, I think. Various types are more helpful.|Maybe you can add contacts of instructions below.|Change the pronouns to "we", that's more close than "you".|
